# Philosophers

*Script to parse quotes from philosophers and do silly things to them*

Right now this script does what it's supposed to, but it kind of sucks. The replacements work, but it doesn't really generate anything interesting. Mostly just jumbled words. The parts of speech replace fine, but without context so it doesn't make even the slightest bit of sense.

 * [Wordnik API](http://developer.wordnik.com/docs.html) to get random words
